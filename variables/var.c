/* 
    A variable name can only have letters (both uppercase and lowercase letters), digits and underscore.
    The first letter of a variable should be either a letter or an underscore.
    There is no rule on how long a variable name (identifier) can be. However, you may run into problems in some compilers if the variable name is longer than 31 characters.
The different bases are :
Decimal: 0, -9, 22 etc
Octal: 021, 077, 033 etc
Hexadecimal: 0x7f, 0x2a, 0x521 etc
"good"                  //string constant
""                     //null string constant
"      "               //string constant of six white space
"x"                    //string constant having a single character.
"Earth is round\n"         //prints string with a newline
If you want to define a variable whose value cannot be changed, you can use the const keyword. This will create a constant
void is an incomplete type. It means "nothing" or "no type". You can think of void as absent. you cannot create variables of void type.
